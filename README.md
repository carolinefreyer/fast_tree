# FastTree

Implementation of the FastTree algorithm (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/7/1641/1128976) for the course CS4255.

## How to run

Running `main.py` in the src folder will write the phylogenetic tree corresponding to the input file in newick format to `fasttree-newick-output.txt`, which can be found in the data folder.
The input file can be changed by altering the argument for the initialize_sequences function, which is called inside the run function.
