# FastTree

Implementation of the FastTree algorithm from [FastTree: Computing Large Minimum Evolution Trees with Profiles instead of a Distance Matrix](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/7/1641/1128976) by Price et. al. (2009) for the course CS4255.

## How to run

Running `main.py` in the src folder will write the phylogenetic tree corresponding to the input file in newick format to `fasttree-newick-output.txt`, which can be found in the data folder.
The input file can be changed by altering the argument for the initialize_sequences function, which is called inside the run function.
